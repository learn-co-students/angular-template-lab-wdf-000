# Using a Directive with a template

## Objectives

- Create a template for our Directive

## Instructions

To do this lab, you'll need to run `npm install` in your console. You'll also need to then run `node server.js`, starting a local webserver. Go to `http://localhost:8080` and start coding!

We've already created directives with a template.  Let's take our existing directives in this repo and change the templates over to be using `templateUrl` instead! Create two new template files for the "Success" and "Error" directives and link them up using `templateUrl`!
